<p>
    Don't you just love to compare the size of things
    to the Space Needle? I know I do. For example, at 328 feet, Godzilla is 1.84
    Space Needles tall. We better hope Godzilla doesn't come to Seattle.

    So, the question them is:
    <blockquote>How many space needles tall are you?</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
    Me? I am .0099 Space Needles tall, and yet I weight a scant .00004 Space Needles.

<p><small>btw - the Space Needle is 605 ft tall and weighs 9,550 tons.</small></p>
