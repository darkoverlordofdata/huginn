<p>
    I've redisigned the site, so that it is now split between
    Git Hub pages and OpenShift.
</p>
<p>
    The static content, such as this blog, is created using Jekyll and
    published to github.
</p>
<p>
    Katra has also been converted to static pages. All of the dynamic content
    is now generated on the client using jQuery and AJAX.
</p>
<p>
    Other dynamic content has been moved to OpenShift:
    <ul>
    <li><strong><a href="exspresso.darkoverlordofdata.com">Exspresso</a></strong> Coffeescript Web Framework.</li>
    <li><strong><a href="cdn.darkoverlordofdata.com">CDN</a></strong> Dark Overlord of Data assets in a browsable cdn.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
